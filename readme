Calcualtes FGR rate after inverting the spectral density.
This code calculates FGR and Marcus rate with varition with k_LT (relaxation rate). All other parameters are specified in fgr.inp. The code is parallelized using openmp.
Mkl library (Blas/Lapack) and openmp are needed. Compilation instructions are there in makefile.

To run, issue 
make 
./aout
